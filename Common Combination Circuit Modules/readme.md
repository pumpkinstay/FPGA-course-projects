Experimental task:  
1.  Design an absolute value circuit that finds the difference between two numbers  
It is required to design the circuit in a multi-level structure, that is, to call the basic modules such as the data selector, the adder and the comparator to design the circuit.  
2.  Design mode comparator circuit  
3.  Design 12s timer circuit  
with LED indicator and button function
